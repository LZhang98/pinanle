# Pinanle

Forked from [Shizerq](https://github.com/Shizerq/sluchajfun), a clone of [Heardle](https://heardle.app) for piano pieces.

# Contributing

In `/src/constants`, rename `sample-songs.ts` to `songs.ts`, and change `startDate` to something reasonable (perhaps the current day, or something 1 or 2 days before).

If you want to reset guess data, use `localStorage.clear()` in the browser console.

# Building (default React stuff)

Ensure you've done the first step in the `Contributing` section.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn`
Installs all the required dependencies.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
